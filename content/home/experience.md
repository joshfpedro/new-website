  description = """Conducted research on the econometrics of network formation. In most of the real world social and economic networks, there are some common features, which are widely observed. “Homophily”, which refers to the tendency of individuals to make connections or friendships with other like-minded individuals, and “degree heterogeneity”, which refers to the variation in the total number of links per individual, are some of the common features. The presence, absence, and magnitude of such features influence information diffusion, the spread of epidemics, and social learning procedures on the underlying networks."""
